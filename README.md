# Affordable Housing Forecaster
Python-based forecasting tool created for my AP Research Final Project, ultimately used to output housing price predictions on the all nine counties within the Bay Area.

# Project Abstract
Create a forecasting algorithm using neural network models (RNN & LSTM) and past housing data that can predict future housing affordability (2025-2027) within the San Francisco Bay Area. Additionally, a scalable Housing Affordability Index (HAI) calculator will be used to condense all the economic and time series data from the past 6 years (2019-2024).

# Prerequisites
