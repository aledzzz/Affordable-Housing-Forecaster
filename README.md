# Affordable Housing Forecaster
Python-based forecasting tool created for my AP Research Final Project, ultimately used to output housing price predictions on the all nine counties within the Bay Area.

# Project Abstract
- Create a forecasting algorithm using neural network models (RNN & LSTM) and past housing data that can predict future housing affordability (2025-2027) within the San Francisco Bay Area. Additionally, a scalable Housing Affordability Index (HAI) calculator will be used to condense all the economic and time series data from the past 5 years (2019-2024).

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.12

(*NEED TO FINISH*)

# How to Run the Program
1.) Clone git respository
```
git clone https://github.com/aledzzz/Affordable-Housing-Forecaster.git
```
2.) Create virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
3.) Install libaries / dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.) Run RNN and LSTM models
```
Start main.py file
```

# How to Make Changes to Main Code
1. Fork Repository
2. Create Branch (`git checkout -b "branch name"`)
3. Stage Changes (`git add .`)
4. Commit new changes (`git commit -m "enter message here"`)
5. Push changes to main branch (`git push origin main`)
